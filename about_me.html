            <p>Hi, there!</p>
            <br>
            <p>I'm Emirhan, studying Computer Science at University of Toronto, Scarborough</p>
            <br>
            <p>Other than being a CS student, <i>in typical fashion</i> who has a "shower-o-phobia" (nah just kidding), I do infact occasionally touch grass and do film photography and poetry.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I usually code in C, Python, and Javascript, although trying to get into Rust lately (the only cult I would like to be a member of), </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>I am half Turkish, half Persian btw (not the best combination for TSA screenings)</p>
            <p>and know English, Turkish, German, and a bit of Portuguese</p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>Please make yourself at home! (shouldn't be too much of a hassle as considering that there is a high chance of you being a fellow software developer, already being in your home)</p>
